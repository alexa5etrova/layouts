            <ul>
                <li><span class="dates">1850, 15 January</span> - was born in Moscow, Russian Empire
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1868</span> - she contracted a "fictitious marriage" with Vladimir Kovalevskij,
                    a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical. Women were not allowed to attend
                    universities in Russia. In order to study abroad, Sofia needed written permission from her father
                    (or husband)
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1869</span> - they moved from Russia to Germany, after a brief stay in Vienna,
                    in order to pursue advanced studies
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1869,April</span> - obtained permission to audit classes with the professors'
                    approval at the University of Heidelberg
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1870,October</span> - Sofia moved to Berlin, where she began to take private
                    lessons with Karl Weierstrass. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the
                    subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university
                </li>
                <li> <span class="dates">1871 </span>- she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to
                    help in the Paris Commune
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1874</span> - Sofia presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on
                    the dynamics of Saturn's rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her
                    doctoral dissertation. Kovalevskaya thereby became <strong>the first woman to have been awarded a
                        doctorate at a European university</strong>.
                </li>
                <li> <span class="dates">1884</span> - Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as
                    Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta
                    Mathematica
                </li>
                <li><span class="dates">1888</span> - she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her
                    work "Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point
                    fixe, où l'intégration s'effectue à l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps"
                </li>
                <li> <span class="dates">1889 </span>- Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at
                    Stockholm University, <strong>the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a
                        position</strong>.
                </li>
                <li> <span class="dates">1891</span> - Kovalevskaya died of influenza complicated by pneumonia at age
                    forty-one
                </li>

                <p>... the more I reflect on her life and consider the magnitude of her achievements, set against the
                    weight of the obstacles she had to overcome, the more I admire her. For me she has taken on a heroic
                    stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world
                    almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a
                    doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination.
                    To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a
                    considerable talent, developed through iron discipline. </p>
